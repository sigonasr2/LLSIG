A song has notes on specific beats, and the editor should account for that.

Chart format:
First line contains a BPM setter.

BPM setters have a millisecond value followed by a decimal number (Comma-separated).

The millisecond value indicates where in the song the BPM should be applied to. From that point forward,
every note will reference to this new offset until either the song finishes or a new BPM setter is applied.

Example:
170,140

A BPM of 140 will be set starting at 170ms into the playing of the song. At 140 BPM, every second references
~2.333333 notes, or ~428.57ms.

A note is defined as:
	The lane it's located on (0-8)
	The type of note (NORMAL or HOLD)
	The start point of note in relation to the current BPM setter.
	The end point of the note in relation to the current BPM setter (-1 for a NORMAL note).
	
The starting point of a note in relation to the current BPM setter is defined as follows:

Assume that an integer indicates how many beats within that BPM section we are in.
So Beat 0 is moment 170, Beat 1 is moment 170+428.57, etc. etc.

In this manner, we can easily adjust all the beats based on offset should we need to fix the BPM setter later.
Everything just shifts with it but stays on beat.

The only tricky part is defining non-aligned beats.

For eighth notes, we will use 0.5. So a note on Beat 3.5 is an eighth note right after Beat 3.
Sixteenth notes use 0.25.

For triplets, use 0.33333. There will be some precision loss, but we will use 0.33333,0.66667,and 1.0 respectively.
For sixteenth triplets, use 0.01667,0.33333,0.5,0.66667,0.83333,1.0

If a note uses something that is not one of these values, it is likely unsnapped.

Every note will be given a color (DDR style)
	- Quarter notes are red.
	- Eighth notes are blue.
	- Sixteenth notes are yellow.
	- 1/6th notes are purple.
	- 1/12th notes are green.
